# Welcome to SIP/NJ Library!

Hi!, I'm **Juan Jimenez** and in collaboration with my friend **Noe Gomez** we have developed this library to support the **FinMC/SIP company**.

Together our areas have gathered styles and sections of code as well as custom functions for the compilation of this library. One of our priorities is to automate the layout and development of landing pages, funnels among other pages in an automated way so that everyone in our area gets involved in their development and it is easier for them to edit and build them.

## Use

To incorporate our library via composer, you need to execute the following command in the project folder

    composer require juanjimeneztj/gsweb

This command will download the files necessary for the use of the library in general, this library includes compilations of both Bootstrap and Fontawesome so that it is not necessary to incorporate them remotely, although you always have the possibility of doing so if you wish.

To include the library in the project you are developing, you only have to add the following files to your project:

 - bootstrap.min.css 
 - gsweb.css 
 - fontawesome.all.css 
 - gsweb.js

Here is an example:

**CSS:**

    <link  rel="stylesheet"  href="./vendor/juanjimeneztj/gsweb/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link  rel="stylesheet"  href="./vendor/juanjimeneztj/gsweb/dist/css/gsweb.css">
    <link  rel="stylesheet"  href="./vendor/juanjimeneztj/gsweb/dist/css/fontawesome.all.css">

**JS:**

    <script src="./vendor/juanjimeneztj/gsweb/dist/js/gsweb.js" async></script>

**It is very important to include the Jquery library, since the project is based on it, otherwise certain options / functions will stop working.**

Here is one of the libraries that we use but it may be the one of your preference, the only requirement is that it be higher than version.

    <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js'></script>
